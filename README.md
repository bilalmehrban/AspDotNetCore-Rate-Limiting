# Implementing API Rate Limiting in ASP.NET Core 7.0 Web API

Rate limiting is an essential technique used to control the number of requests that can be made to an API within a specified time frame. It is commonly used to protect APIs from being overwhelmed by abusive or malicious requests.
In ASP.NET Core, you can implement rate limiting using various libraries and techniques.

There are two main ways to implement rate limiting in ASP.NET Core:

- Using the built-in rate limiting middleware
- Using a third-party rate limiting library

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to add rate limiting to your ASP.NET Core application using the built-in rate limiting middleware

## Getting Started

To get started with this ASP.NET Core web API project, you will need the following:

- Visual Studio 2022 or any similar IDE that supports ASP.NET Core development
- ASP.NET Core 7 SDK

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 or any similar IDE that supports ASP.NET Core development.
2. Install the latest version of the ASP.NET Core 7 SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0).
3. Clone the project from GitHub or download the ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.
4. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
5. Build the project by clicking on the "Build" button or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
6. Run the project by clicking on the "Run" button or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+F5`.
7. Test the API endpoints by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate URLs.

That's it! With the rate limiting implemented, you can now test its functionality. Make requests to your API and observe how the rate limiting rules are enforced. Requests that exceed the defined limits will receive a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code.
By following these steps, you can successfully add rate limiting to your ASP.NET Core application, protecting it from abusive or malicious requests.

For more advanced configurations and options, refer to the documentation of the specific rate limiting library you are using.

Remember to adjust the rate limit policies based on your application's requirements and expected traffic patterns.

**Note:** This is a general guide, and the actual implementation details may vary depending on the specific rate limiting library or approach you choose to use in your ASP.NET Core application.
